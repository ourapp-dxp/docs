# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use ourapp.studio. We’ll cover how to get started generating an app using the studio editor and list your first product for sale. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make an app in ourapp.studio, you will need to register an account. [You can register for free here](https://ourapp.io/register).

## Create your first app

After registering or signing in, you'll be automatically directed to the dashboard. This is where you can create new apps, edit or delete existing apps.

## Connecting products and assets to your app

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Protocol API. Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the Conversations endpoint to get a list of all your conversations. In the cURL example, results are limited to ten conversations, the default page length for each client.

## What's next?

Great, you're now set up with an API client and have made your first request to the API. Here are a few links that might be handy as you venture further into the Protocol API:
